**Installing a Printer Driver**

*Printer drivers* are the main way computers accurately communicate to the printer and execute commands in a user-friendly interface. Having incorrect or outdated printer drivers can lead to a variety of printing issues, so it is one of the first key steps in troubleshooting printing issues as they arise.

**Steps to installing a printer driver**
1. Ensure printer hardware is unboxed and set up correctly in an appropriate space for you and/or your client's intended use. Plug in the AC adapter to the back of the printer and ensure it is powered on.
2. Connect the USB-B end of the cable included into the USB port on the printer, then connect the USB-A end of the cable into your computer. If your computer does not have traditional USB-A ports, locate the appropriate adapter.
3. Your computer should automatically recognize a device has been plugged into the port, and ask if you would like to setup the *Printer Wizard*. Select 'Yes'. **If your computer does not recognize the printer skip to step 8, and come back to steps 4-7 later.**
4. Go through the configuration settings within the Printer Wizard to successfully download the printer's up-to-date driver.
5. Once you have completed the Printer Wizard's setup process, click into your computer's settings and look up the attached device. Usually this is found under its own device category, aptly named "Printers".
6. Click on the manufacturer's name for the printer to open its settings. Enable this printer as the 'Default' printer for streamlined access later.
7. Select the 'Test print' button to test your connected device. If the printer produces a page with no text errors, no smudging/ink errors, you have successfully set up your printer, and you can close the Settings window. No further action is needed.
8. If your computer does not automatically recognize the connected device, navigate to the printer manufacturer's webpage to locate the specific driver needed for functionality. This can typically be found in the printer's physical setup guide. Another best practice is to type the specific model name and manufacturer of the printer and locate its driver that way. **Ensure that the driver you install is also compatible with your OS (Mac, Windows, etc).**
9. Once you have downloaded the appropriate driver from the website, launch the driver from your downloads folder, and head back to step 3 to complete setup.

**Conclusion**

Printers, like any hardware device, come with challenges and specific troubleshooting techniques to ensure accurate and efficient operation. Most, if not all, modern printers will include a setup/troubleshooting guide in the original packaging, as well as being available online through the manufacturer's webiste. This is your go-to resource when troubleshooting any issues your printer may face. Be sure to performa routine maintenance on the printer based on the suggested cadences included in the device manual to ensure longer shelf-life.
